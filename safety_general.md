It is every lab member’s responsibility to maintain the health and safety of the lab space, not only the safety coordinators. This includes following lab protocol, keeping the lab space clean and organized, and reporting all problems or incidents. Please report any and all issues to both the safety coordinator and a PI. If you have questions or concerns beyond the safety coordinator or PI, please refer to the following list of key points of contact.
