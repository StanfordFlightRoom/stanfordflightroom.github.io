## General Information
Gaining access to the Stanford Flight Room requires three steps and is dependent on your affiliation to the [associated labs](/contact). 

1. All students must complete the following online safety course before working in the space.  
*EHS-4200-WEB (General Safety, Injury Prevention (IIPP), and Emergency Preparedness)*  
2. All students must complete the lab-specific training corresponding to your affiliation with the associated labs. 
3. Apply for card access depending on your affiliation with the associated labs. 

## Student Members of the Associated Labs
Students who are permanent members of one of the six associated labs can gain access to the flight room and workshop by completing their lab's specific safety training as well as the Stanford Flight Room's specific safety training. Lab specific training is administered by each lab's safety coordinator. 

## Students Who Are Not Members of the Associated Labs
Students who are not permanent members of one of the six associated labs can apply for access through [Mykel Kochenderfer](http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/). Card access to the space will be granted **only** for the flying and command rooms (**not** the workshop). After speaking with Mykel and completing step 1 above, contact a student [point-of-contact](/contact) for the Stanford Flight Room's lab-specific safety training.
