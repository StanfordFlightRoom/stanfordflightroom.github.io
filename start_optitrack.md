### What is Optitrack?
Optitrack is the motion capture system created by Natural Point that is installed in the Stanford Flight Room. The system is used via Natural Point's software Motive that is installed on the desktop computer `mocap`.  

The Optitrack system is already installed in the flight room and should not be modified. This means that cameras should not be moved, rotated, or re-focused. The system's hardware configuration is illustrated in the [Wiring Diagram](/setup_wiring_diagram). 

### How do I start using Optitrack?
Refer to [Motive Software](/motion_capture_motive)

### How do I read data from Optitrack on my personal computer (or robot)?
Refer to [Using ROS](/start_ros)

### Can I do more advanced things with Motive and Optitrack?
Sure! Refer to the [Natural Point Wiki](https://v20.wiki.optitrack.com/index.php?title=OptiTrack_Documentation_Wiki).
