* Add a description of what you are doing and include:
	* Your email address
	* If you can share the space with others while working (think initial robot setup vs full-room experiments)
	* Example: Configuring a new robot (others may use the space). Contact: ravi@stanford.edu
	* Example: Collecting final experimental data for paper (need entire space). Contact: adam@stanford.edu
